**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Analyze these grouped events as a whole to identify:
1. Is this a coordinated attack pattern or normal traffic?
2. What type of attack or activity is this (if malicious)?
3. What is the overall threat level for this IP?
4. What actions should be taken?

Please respond in JSON format with:
1. severity_rating: An integer from 0-5 (0=safe, 1=info, 2=low, 3=medium, 4=high, 5=critical)
2. attack_type: Type of attack or activity (e.g., "SQL Injection Attempt", "Directory Scanning", "Benign Access", "Bot Activity", "Brute Force")
3. rating_reason: Brief explanation of why this specific severity rating was chosen (1 sentence)
4. security_analysis: Detailed explanation of what you observed across all events (2-3 sentences)
5. recommended_actions: Specific actions to take (e.g., "Block IP", "Monitor closely", "No action needed")

**ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**
- Consider frequency: Many events in short time = higher severity
- Look for patterns: Same URIs, rules, methods indicate purposeful activity

**CRITICAL: Directory Scanning Severity Rules:**
- CHECK THE "UNIQUE URIs ACCESSED" NUMBER ABOVE
- If UNIQUE URIs >= 10 with WordPress/admin/system paths â†’ YOU MUST rate severity 4 or 5
- Directory scanning is ALWAYS high severity whether BLOCKED or ALLOWED
- ALLOWED scanning is MORE dangerous (successful reconnaissance)
- Example: 16 different WordPress URIs = severity 4 or 5 (NOT severity 3)

**Other Attack Severities:**
- SQL injection, XSS patterns = severity 4-5
- Brute force attacks (repeated login attempts, credential stuffing) = severity 4-5
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) attempts = severity 5
- API abuse (excessive requests, rate limit violations) = severity 3-4
- Single blocked request = lower severity than repeated attempts

Example format:
{{
  "severity_rating": 4,
  "attack_type": "SQL Injection Attempt",
  "rating_reason": "47 automated SQL injection attempts in 12 minutes indicates active attack campaign. so, the rating is 4.",
  "security_analysis": "This IP made 47 attempts to inject SQL commands into the login form over 12 minutes. All requests were blocked by rule 'SQLi-BODY'. Pattern indicates automated scanning tool.",
  "recommended_actions": "Block this IP at firewall level and monitor for similar activity from other IPs in the same subnet."
